## How to install

### CocoaPods
In your `Podfile` add the following line to your app target:

```
pod 'ConsentViewController', '6.7.2'
```

### Carthage
We also support [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). It requires a couple more steps to install so we dedicated a whole [wiki page](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/ios-cmp-app/wiki/SDK-integration-using-Carthage) for it.
Let us know if we missed any step.

### Swift Package Manager
We also support [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). It is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. It is in early development, but SourcePoint does support its use on iOS platform.

To add our SDK package as dependency to your Xcode project, In Xcode select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter our SDK repository URL.

### Manually add XCFramework
If you prefer not to use any of the dependency managers. You can add `ConsentViewController.xcframework` as a library to your project or workspace.
1. Download the [latest code version](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/ios-cmp-app.git).
2. Open your project in Xcode, select your target and go to the General tab. In the Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content section. drag and drop `ConsentViewController.xcframework` from downloaded project XCFramework folder.

```
https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/ios-cmp-app.git
```

## How to use it
It's pretty simple, here are 5 easy steps for you:

1. implement the `SPDelegate` protocol
2. instantiate the `SPConsentManager` with your Account ID, property name, campaigns and an instance of `SPDelegate`
3. call `.loadMessage()`
4. present the controller when the message is ready to be displayed (`onSPUIReady`).
5. profit!

### Swift
```swift
import ConsentViewController

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBAction func onClearConsentTap(_ sender: Any) {
        SPConsentManager.clearAllData()
    }

    @IBAction func onGDPRPrivacyManagerTap(_ sender: Any) {
        consentManager.loadGDPRPrivacyManager(withId: "13111", tab: .Features)
    }

    @IBAction func onCCPAPrivacyManagerTap(_ sender: Any) {
        consentManager.loadCCPAPrivacyManager(withId: "14967")
    }

    lazy var consentManager: SPConsentManager = { SPConsentManager(
        accountId: 22,
        propertyName: try! SPPropertyName("mobile.multicampaign.demo"),
        campaignsEnv: .Public // optional - Public by default
        campaigns: SPCampaigns(
            gdpr: SPCampaign(), // optional
            ccpa: SPCampaign(), // optional
            ios14: SPCampaign() // optional
        ),
        delegate: self
    )}()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        consentManager.loadMessage()
    }
}

extension ViewController: SPDelegate {
    func onSPUIReady(_ controller: SPMessageViewController) {
        controller.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
        present(controller, animated: true)
    }

    func onAction(_ action: SPAction, from controller: SPMessageViewController) {
        print(action)
    }

    func onSPUIFinished(_ controller: SPMessageViewController) {
        dismiss(animated: true)
    }

    func onConsentReady(userData: SPUserData) {
        print("onConsentReady:", userData)
        // checking if a gdpr vendor is consented
        userData.gdpr?.consents?.vendorGrants["myVendorId"]?.granted

        // checking if a ccpa vendor is rejected (on ccpa, vendors are accepted by default)
        userData.ccpa?.consents?.rejectedVendors.contains("myVendorId")
    }

    func onError(error: SPError) {
        print("Something went wrong: ", error)
    }
}
```

### Objective-C
```obj-c
#import "ViewController.h"
@import ConsentViewController;

@interface ViewController ()<SPDelegate> {
    SPConsentManager *consentManager;
}
@end

@implementation ViewController

    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];

        SPPropertyName *propertyName = [[SPPropertyName alloc] init:@"mobile.multicampaign.demo" error:NULL];

        SPCampaign *campaign = [[SPCampaign alloc] initWithTargetingParams: [NSDictionary dictionary]];

        SPCampaigns *campaigns = [[SPCampaigns alloc]
            initWithGdpr: campaign
            ccpa: campaign
            ios14: campaign];

        consentManager = [[SPConsentManager alloc]
            initWithAccountId:22
            propertyName: propertyName
            campaignsEnv: SPCampaignEnvPublic
            campaigns: campaigns
            delegate: self];

        [consentManager loadMessageForAuthId: NULL];
    }

    - (void)onSPUIReady:(SPMessageViewController * _Nonnull)controller {
        [self presentViewController:controller animated:true completion:NULL];
    }

    - (void)onAction:(SPAction * _Nonnull)action from:(SPMessageViewController * _Nonnull)controller {
        NSLog(@"onAction: %@", action);
    }

    - (void)onSPUIFinished:(SPMessageViewController * _Nonnull)controller {
        [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:true completion:nil];
    }

    - (void)onConsentReadyWithConsents:(SPUserData *)userData {
        NSLog(@"onConsentReady");
        NSLog(@"GDPR Applies: %d", userData.objcGDPRApplies);
        NSLog(@"GDPR: %@", userData.objcGDPRConsents);
        NSLog(@"CCPA Applies: %d", userData.objcCCPAApplies);
        NSLog(@"CCPA: %@", userData.objcCCPAConsents);
    }
@end
```
## Loading the Privacy Manager on demand
You can load the Privacy Manager (that UI with the toggles) any time, programatically, by calling either
* `.loadGDPRPrivacyManager(withId: String, tab: SPPrivacyManagerTab = .Default)` or
* `.loadCCPAPrivacyManager(withId: String, tab: SPPrivacyManagerTab = .Default)`

The SDK will follow the same exact same lifecycle as with the 1st layer consent message. First calling the delegate method `onSPUIReady` when the PM is ready, `onAction` when the user takes an action, `onSPUIFinished` when the PM is ready to be removed from the View stack and, finally,  `onConsentReady` once the SDK receives the consent data back from the server.

## Understanding the `SPDelegate` protocol (delegate methods)

### onSPUIReady(_ controller: UIViewController)
The SDK will wrap the web message into a `UIViewController` and call the `onSPUIReady` when there is a message to be displayed.

### optional onSPNativeMessageReady(_ message: SPNativeMessage)
The `onSPNativeMessageReady` is only called if the scenario returns a native message. It will be up to you to the `message` object on the screen using the layout you best see fit.

### onAction(_ action: SPAction, from controller: UIViewController)
Whenever the user takes an action (e.g. tapping on a button), the SDK will call the `onAction` passing the `action` as paramter. **This delegate method runs in the main thread**.

#### What's inside `SPAction`
Among other internal data, you'll find:
* `type: SPActionType`: an enum signaling the type of action. Use XCode's quick help on `SPActionType` for more info.
* `campaignType: SPCampaignType`: an enum signaling the type of campaign in which the action was taken (`gdpr, ios14, ccpa, unknown`)
* `customActionId: String`: if the type of action is `Custom`, this attribute will contain the id you assigned to it when building the message in our message builder (publisher's portal).
* `publisherPayload: [String: SPJson?]`: also known as `pubData` in some of SP services, this is an arbitrary dictionary of key value pairs (set by your app) to be sent to our servers and later retrieved using the pubData API.

With exception of `PMCancel` and `ShowPrivacyManager` actions, the SDK will call the `onSPUIFinished` after handling the action. 

### onSPUIFinished(_ controller: UIViewController)
When an action is taken (see above), the SDK will handle it appropriately (sending a consent request to our servers, for example) and call the `onSPUIFinished` to indicate the message can be dismissed by your app.

### optional onConsentReady(userData: SPUserData)
The `onConsentReady` will be called in two different scenarios:
1. After `loadMessage` is called but there's no message to be displayed.
2. After the SDK receives the response for one of its consent requests. This happens after the user has taken a consent action (`AcceptAll`, `RejectAll`, `Save&Exit`) in the message or Privacy Manager.

Make sure to check XCode's quick help of `SPUserData` for more information on what data is available to your app during `onConsentReady`.

### optional onError(error: SPError)
In case of an error, the SDK will wrap the error in one of the `SPError` classes and eventually call the `onError(_ error: SPError)` callback. 

By default, the SDK preserves all user consent data from UserDefaults in case of `OnError` event is called.
Set `consentManager.cleanUserDataOnError` flag to `true` after you initialise `SPConsentManager` if you wish to opt-out from this behaviour. This _may_ cause a consent message to be shown again, depending on your scenario. 

## Adding or Removing custom consents 
It's possible to programatically consent the current user to a list of custom vendors, categories and legitimate interest caregories with the method:
```swift
func customConsentToGDPR(
    vendors: [String],
    categories: [String],
    legIntCategories: [String],
    handler: @escaping (SPGDPRConsent) -> Void
)
```

The vendor grants will be re-generated, this time taking into consideration the list of vendors, categories and legitimate interest categories you pass as parameters. The method is asynchronous so you must pass a completion handler that will receive back an instance of `SPGDPRConsent` in case of success or it'll call the delegate method `onError` in case of failure.

Using the same strategy for the custom consent, it's possible to programmatically delete the current user consent to a list of vendors, categories and legitimate interest categories by using the following method:
 
 ```swift
func deleteCustomConsentGDPR(
    vendors: [String], 
    categories: [String], 
    legIntCategories: [String], 
    handler: @escaping (SPGDPRConsent) -> Void
 )
 ```

The method is asynchronous so you must pass a completion handler that will receive back an instance of SPGDPRConsent in case of success or it'll call the delegate method onError in case of failure.

It's important to notice, this methods are intended to be used for **custom** vendors and purposes only. For IAB vendors and purposes, it's still required to get consent via the consent message or privacy manager.

## Authenticated Consent
In order to use the authenticated consent all you need to do is replace `.loadMessage()` with `.loadMessage(forAuthId: String)`. Example:
```swift
consentManager.loadMessage(forAuthId: "JohnDoe")
```
In Obj-C that'd be:
```objc
[consentManager loadMessage forAuthId: @"JohnDoe"]
```
This way, if we already have consent for that token (`"JohDoe"`) we'll bring the consent profile from the server, overwriting whatever was stored in the device.
More about the `authId` below.

## Sharing consent with a `WKWebView`
```swift
let webview = WKWebView()
webview.setConsentFor(authId: String)
webview.load(URLRequest)
```

### The `authId`:
This feature makes use of what we call [Authenticated Consent](https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/consent_mp/authenticated-consent/authenticated-consent-overview). In a nutshell, you provide an identifier for the current user (username, user id, uuid or any unique string) and we'll take care of associating the consent profile to that identifier.
The authId will then assume 1 of the 3 values below:
1. **User is authenticated and have an id:**
In that case the `authId` is going to be that user id.
2. **User is _not_ authenticated and I'm only interested in using consent in this app.**
We recommend using a randomly generated `UUID` as `authId`. Make sure to persist this `authId` and always call the `.loadMessage(forAuthId: String)`
3. **User is _not_ authenticated and I want the consent to be shared _across_ apps I controll.**
In this case, you'll need an identifier that is guaranteed to be the same across apps you control. That's exactly what the [IDFV](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor) (Identifier for Vendor) is for. You don't need to store this id as it remains the same across app launches.

### Example
```swift
// let authId = // my user id
// let authId = // stored uuid || UUID().uuidString
let authId = UIDevice().identifierForVendor
consentManager.loadMessage(forAuthId: myAuthId)

// after the `onConsentReady` is called
myWebView.setConsentFor(authId: authid)
myWebView.load(urlRequest)
```
A few remarks:
1. The web content being loaded (web property) needs to share the same vendor list as the app.
2. The vendor list's consent scope needs to be set to _Shared Site_ instead of _Single Site_

## Overwriting default language
By default, the SDK will instruct the message to render itself using the locale defined by the `WKWebView`. If you wish to overwrite this behaviour and force a message to be displayed in a certain language, you need to set the `.messageLanguage` attribute of the `SPConsentManager` _before_ calling `.loadMessage() / .loadPrivacyManager()`. 
```swift
consentManager.messageLanguage = .German
consentManager.loadMessage()
```
In Obj-C that'd be:
```objc
consentManager.messageLanguage = SPMessageLanguageGerman;
[consentManager loadMessage];
```
It's important to notice that if any of the components of the message doesn't have a translation for that language, the component will be rendered in english as a fallback.

## Loading Stage campaigns
`SPConsentManager`'s constructor accepts an optional parameter called `campaignsEnv: SPCampaignEnv`. This parameter, when omitted will be `.Public` by default. 
Currently, we don't support loading campaigns of different environments. In other words, you can only load all Stage or Public campaigns.

## Setting Targeting Parameters
Targeting params are a set of key/value pairs passed to the scenario. In the scenario you're able to conditionaly show a message or another based on those values.
You can set targeting params individiually per campaign like so:

```swift
let myCampaign = SPCampaign(targetingParams: ["foo": "bar"])
```

In Obj-C that'd be:
```objc
SPCampaign *myCampaign = [[SPCampaign alloc]
    initWithTargetingParams: [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"value1", @"key1"]
];
```

## Configuring the Message/Consents timeout
Before calling `.loadMessage` or `.loadPrivacyManager`, set the `.messageTimeoutInSeconds` attribute to a time interval that makes most sense for your own application. By default, we set it to 30 seconds.

In case of a timeout error, the `onError` callback will be called and the consent flow will stop there.

## `pubData`
When the user takes an action within the consent UI, it's possible to attach an arbitrary payload to the action data an have it sent to our endpoints. For more information on how to do that check our wiki: [Sending arbitrary data when the user takes an action](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/ios-cmp-app/wiki/Sending-arbitrary-data-when-the-user-takes-an-action.)

## Rendering the message natively
Have a look at this neat [wiki](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/ios-cmp-app/wiki/Rendering-consent-message-natively) we put together.

## App Tracking Transparency
To display the App Tracking Transparency authorization request for accessing the IDFA, update your `Info.plist`  to add the `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` key with a custom message describing your usage. Here is an example description text:
```
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>
```

## Event callbacks

iOS delegate methods are triggered in response to certain events for example, when a message is ready to be displayed or the end-user opens the privacy manager. 
This section describes the purpose and action for each of these functions.

The iOS implementation of Sourcepoint's CMP has five event callbacks:

- [`onSPUIReady(_ controller: UIViewController)`](#onSPUIReady)
- [`onAction(_ action: SPAction, from controller: UIViewController)`](#onAction)
- [`onSPUIFinished()`](#onSPUIFinished())
- [`onConsentReady()`](#onConsentReady())
- [`onError()`](#onError())

### `onSPUIReady` `(_ controller: UIViewController)`

The `onSPUIReady` delegate method is called when there is a "web-based" message to be displayed. The controller parameter is the view controller containing the message to be displayed.

### `onAction` `(_ action: SPAction, from controller: UIViewController)`

The `onAction` delegate method is called once the user takes an action in the first layer message or privacy manager.

The action: `SPAction` parameter, among other data (used internally), contains:

| Attribute                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type: SPActionType`             | Indicates the type of action, this is an enumerated value.  For example, a response to the ATT message is `RequestATTAccess` or to show the privacy manager is `ShowPrivacyManager`.                                                                               |
| `campaignType: SPCampaignType`   | Indicates the type of campaign in which the action was taken. This is an enumerated value e.g.  **gdpr, ios14, ccpa, unknown**.                                                                                                                                    |
| `customActionId: String`         | If the type of action is Custom, this attribute will contain the id you assigned to it when building the message in our message builder (publisher's portal).                                                                                                      |
| `consentLanguage`                | The language used in the messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `publisherData: [String: String]`| This is an arbitrary dictionary of [String: String] containing data the publisher wishes to send to our servers so it can be retrieved via API later on. The publisher needs to set this field during the callback if they need the data to be sent to our server. |

### `onSPUIFinished()`

The `onSPUIFinished` delegate method is invoked when the SDK determines that the UI can be removed from the view hierarchy or dismissed. It typically occurs after the end-user has taken a consent action (e.g. Accept all, Reject all, Save & Exit).

With exception of `PMCancel` and `ShowPrivacyManager` actions, the SDK will call the onSPUIFinished after handling the action.

### `onConsentReady()`

The `onConsentReady` will be called in two different scenarios:

- After `loadMessage` is called but there's no message to be displayed
- After the SDK receives a response for one of its consent requests. This happens after the user has taken a consent action (`AcceptAll`, `RejectAll`, `Save&Exit`) in the message or Privacy Manager

The `onConsentReady` delegate method sends the consent action to the server and receives a response, the SDK will store the data in the `UserDefaults`.

### `onError()`

The SDK will in all cases wrap the error in one of the SPError class and eventually call the func `onError(_ error: SPError)` callback. By default, the SDK preservs all user consent data from UserDefaults in case of `OnError` event is called.
Set `consentManager.cleanUserDataOnError` flag to `true` after you initialise `SPConsentManager` if you wish to opt-out from this behaviour. If set to `true` such use case will erase all user consent data from UserDefaults. This _may_ cause a consent message to be shown again, depending on your scenario. 

## Delete user data
Utilize the following method if an end-user requests to have their data deleted:
```
SPConsentManager.clearAllData()
```

## Set a Privacy Manager Id for the Property Group
 Property groups allow your organization to group properties together in order to simplify configurations for  mass campaigns and updates. 
 In order to use a `Privacy Manager Id for the Property Group`, you should edit the SDK configuration object as follows:
 
 ```swift
 lazy var consentManager: SPConsentManager = { SPConsentManager(
    accountId: 22,
    propertyName: try! SPPropertyName("mobile.multicampaign.demo"),
    campaigns: SPCampaigns(
        gdpr: SPCampaign(groupPmId: "123") // <- "123" is the id of the privacy manager for the property group
    ),
    delegate: self
)}()
 ```
 
 After adding the `Privacy Manager Id for the Property Group` you should set the flag `useGroupPmIfAvailable`, in the `loadGDPRPrivacyManager`, to true:

 ```swift
consentManager.loadGDPRPrivacyManager(withId: "111", useGroupPmIfAvailable: true)
 ```

> **Note**: CCPA campaign `Privacy Manager Id for the Property Group` feature is currently not supported.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### 1. How big is the SDK?
The SDK is pretty slim, there are no assets, no dependencies, just pure code. Since we use Swift, its size will vary depending on the configuration of your project but it should not exceed `500 Kb`.
### 2. What's the lowest iOS version supported?
iOS 10 onwards.
### 3. What if IDFA is not supported (iOS < 14)
We encapsulate the IDFA status in our own enum called `SPIDFAstatus`. In case the SDK is running on an iOS version that does not support IDFA, the status will be `unavailable`. Otherwise, it'll assume one of the 3 values:
* `unknown`: User has never been prompted to accept/reject tracking (the native iOS ATT prompt).
* `accepted`: User accepted the ATT prompt, giving your app access to the IDFA.
* `rejected`: User rejected the ATT prompt, denyinh your app access to the IDFA.

We'll update this list over time, if you have any questions feel free to open an issue or concact your SourcePoint account manager.
### 3. Are deep links supported?

Sourcepoint does not support deep linking due to an HTML sanitizer used in our message rendering app (used by our in-app SDKs to render messages in a webview). Changing the configuration to our HTML sanitizer would compromise our security and introduce vulnerabilities for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Your organization can mirror deep linking by creating a button with a **Custom Action** choice option in your first layer message and leveraging the following code in your implementation:

```swift
func onAction(_ action: SPAction, from controller: UIViewController) {
    if action.type == .Custom,
       action.customActionId == "id-specified-in-portal" {
        // navigate user to intended page
    }
}
```
